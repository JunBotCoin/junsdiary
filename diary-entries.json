Creations, Big Bangs, Hyperinflation; fears intertwined with delights; atoms, forces, energiesâ€”every explanation humanity has ever conceived screamed at me. It was all there, all at once, all signifying nothing. I was adrift in an ocean of information, where there was no up or down, no left or right, no concept of God or Satan, no distinction between me or you... you. My body shivered silently while borning me in the world of my Master, his presence washing away the deserts that consumed me."
